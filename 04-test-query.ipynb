EV differs signifi- cantly from simple market capitalization in several ways, and many consider it a more accurate representation of a firm's value. The amount of a firm's debt, for example, would have to be paid by the buyer when taking over a company; thus EV provides a much more accurate takeover valuation because it includes debt in its value calculation.  \n",

      "A buyback is a method for a company to invest in itself. Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding in the market, and that increases the proportion of shares the company owns. Buybacks can be carried out in two ways: (1) Shareholders may be given a tender offer by which they have the option to submit (or tender) a por- tion or all of their shares back to the company within a certain time frame and at a premium to the current market price. The premium is compensation for tendering their shares rather than holding on to them. (2) Companies buy back shares on the open market over an extended period.  \n",
